## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of commonly used data structures and algorithms, providing a resource for learning and reference. Whether you are a beginner looking to understand basic concepts or an experienced developer seeking efficient implementations, this repository aims to cater to both audiences.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before using the code in this repository, ensure that you have the necessary programming language runtime installed. Refer to the documentation of the specific language for installation instructions.

### Running the Code

Each data structure and algorithm implementation is organized into its respective directory. Navigate to the desired directory and follow the instructions in the README.md file for that specific implementation.

Example:

```bash
cd algorithms/sorting
python bubble_sort.py

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have a new algorithm or data structure to add, or if you find a bug in an existing implementation, please follow the contribution guidelines.
